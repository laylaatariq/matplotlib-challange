In the first plot Tumor Response Treatment only 2 of the drugs helped in reducing the tumor growth that are Capomulin and Ramicane. Even the standard deviation for these both drugs is less compared to some other drugs.

For these two drugs the spread of metastasis was the least but still not help it from spreading further.

But when considering the amount of mices that it treated is also very less the other factors dont hold that much importance.In oder for a drug to considered successful a lot of factors have to be taken into consideration. For the two of these drugs even though it helped reduce the tumor size and spread to some extent, but the ratio of how many mice compared to other drugs is the least.

Whereas, when we look at the percentage sumamry these two drugs show that they Ramicane was the most successful drug in helping to treat the cancer to some extent. That being said, it is still hard to determine what drug is still considered most efficient as we cannot determine that on only a few factors.
